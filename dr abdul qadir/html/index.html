        <h1>Scientific career in Pakistan:</h1>
        <p><b>Dr. Abdul Qadir is a renowned Pakistani</b> cricketer and former captain of the Pakistan cricket team. He was born on
        September 15, 1955, in Lahore, Pakistan. Qadir was a leg-spin bowler known for his unique and unorthodox bowling style,
        which earned him numerous wickets throughout his cricketing career. He played for Pakistan between 1977 and 1993 and was
        considered one of the best leg-spinners of his time. After retiring from cricket, Qadir remained active in the sport as
        a coach and commentator. He passed away on September 6, 2019, at the age of 63, leaving behind a legacy as one of
        Pakistan's most beloved and talented cricketers."No nuclear bomb" refers to the absence or non-existence of a nuclear weapon, which is a highly destructive explosive
        device that uses nuclear reactions to release an enormous amount of energy. The use of nuclear weapons is generally
        considered a last resort due to the devastating consequences they can have on both human life and the environment. Many
        countries have signed international treaties and agreements to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons, and some
        have even committed to complete nuclear disarmament. The prevention of nuclear war and the promotion of global peace and
        security remain important goals for many nations and international organizations.
